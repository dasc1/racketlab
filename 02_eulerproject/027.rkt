; First we must create a huge reference list of primes that we might
; need to look up.  Since a and b are bounded by 1000, and n is also
; bounded by 1000 (if n matches b, the result is divisible by b) we
; know the max value of n^2 + an + b must be 2001000.  So let's
; create a list of all primes up to that number

(define limit 2001000)

(define twomil (list->vector (range limit)))

(define (elimmults start amt)
  (if (>= start limit) #t
      (begin (vector-set! twomil start 0) (elimmults (+ start amt) amt))))

(define (primelist lst current)
  (cond [(>= current limit) (reverse lst)] ; found all the primes
        [(= 0 (vector-ref twomil current)) ; mult. of lower num - skip it
         (primelist lst (+ current 2))]
        [#t (begin (elimmults (* 2 current) current)
                   (primelist (cons current lst) (+ current 2)))]))

(define prime2mil (primelist '(2) 3))

; next step, we consider all combinations of a and b, and try
; successive values of n for each one, testing for primes.  We
; keep track of the length of the longest chain of primes, and the
; values of a and b that led to that length.

(define (inz v lst)
  (cond [(null? lst) #f]
        [(> v (car lst)) (inz v (cdr lst))]
        [#t (= v (car lst))]))

(define (prime x)
  (inz x prime2mil))
